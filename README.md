# A utility-based analysis of equilibria in multi-objective normal form games

Study of Nash equilibria in MONFGs, under the SER (scalarised expected returns) and ESR (expected scalarised returns) multi-objective criterion.

## Getting Started

Experiments can be run from the `MONFG.py` file. There are 5 MONFGs available, having different equilibria properties under the SER optimisation criterion, using the specified non linear utility functions.
